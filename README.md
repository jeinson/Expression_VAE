# Expression_VAE
A repository for submission of my final project for ML in Functional Genomics, Fall 2019 at Columbia University. 

The goal is to learn hidden covariates in gene expression data using a Variational Autoencoder, 
instead of the factor analysis method called PEER. 

The Colab notebook used to run the vae can accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16-meMeYf6NzFc29Xb-QjOKuEE2a5DDrJ/view?usp=sharing)
